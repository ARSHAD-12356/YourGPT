The state (Extend) is changed by useState, not useEffect. useEffect is only used to observe and react to state changes after they occur. The confusion arises because useState updates the state asynchronously, and the updated value is only available after the component re-renders.


useState Updates the State:

The setExtend function (from useState) is responsible for updating the Extend state.
When you call setExtend((prev) => !prev), it toggles the value of Extend between true and false.
However, this update is asynchronous, meaning the state doesn't change immediately. Instead, React schedules a re-render of the component with the new state.
useEffect Observes State Changes:

The useEffect hook is used to "observe" changes to the Extend state.
Whenever Extend changes, the useEffect callback runs. This is why you see the updated value logged in the console.
useEffect doesn't change the state itselfâ€”it only reacts to the change.
Why the Updated State Isn't Immediately Available:

When you call setExtend, the component doesn't re-render instantly. React batches updates for performance reasons.
This means that if you log Extend immediately after calling setExtend, you'll still see the old value because the re-render hasn't happened yet.
How It Works in Your Code:

When you click the hamburger menu (GiHamburgerMenu), the onClick handler calls setExtend((prev) => !prev).
React schedules a re-render with the new value of Extend.
After the re-render, the useEffect hook runs because Extend has changed, and it logs the updated value.
Example Flow:
Initial state: Extend = false.
You click the hamburger menu.
setExtend((prev) => !prev) is called, toggling Extend to true.
React schedules a re-render.
After the re-render:
The useEffect hook runs because Extend changed.
The updated value (true) is logged to the console.
Why useEffect is Useful:
Without useEffect, you wouldn't have a way to react to state changes after they occur.
For example, if you want to perform side effects (like logging, fetching data, or updating the DOM) when Extend changes, useEffect is the right tool for the job.
In summary, useState updates the state, and useEffect observes and reacts to those updates. They work together to manage and respond to state changes in your component.
